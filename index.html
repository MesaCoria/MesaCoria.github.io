        <h2>Problem statement: Campus Shortcuts</h2> 
        <p>
          Freshman have a hard time finding their way across campus because for most students its their first time being on campus 
          therefore they have to rely on faulty GPS apps like Google maps which does take you to your destination but its not updated
          to show you the best route to certain destinations.
