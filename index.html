        <p>
          New students arrive at the University with no way of knowing how to get to class the fastest way, 
          the best place to park, or even what dining halls would be the most convenient. This causes students
          a lot of stress since map apps will take you on the main route, which might be 10 minutes longer than 
          a short cut or you do not know where other dining halls are, so they are stuck eating the same one every
          day.

          The group worked together in order to brainstorm ideas for an app that helps students, especially 
          incoming freshman. Students want a way to learn what the fastest, most effective way to get to class is. 
          Maps will take you on the most known route even if it 10 minutes longer than a short cut. They also are 
          nervous about where they are going to eat because they don't know all their options, or even where they are 
          located. We also brainstormed about the gyms on campus students want to stay in shape and workout but dont 
          know where all the gyms are, what times they open and close, as well as the occupancy level. We discussed 
          how we would market this tool for students and how we would make it accessible for all. Our group even 
          considered if their should be a social aspect to this tool where students can post clubs or events on campus. 
          Next we talk about it as an app and how it could be created. We also addressed issues that would follow while 
          creating this app. Finally discussed brainstormed if and what images would be added.

          Josh Maverick Rango, a 20-year-old full-time student and exercise trainer, leads a dynamic and disciplined life. 
          He balances his mornings between a nutritious breakfast and rigorous personal training sessions at the gym or outdoors. 
          In between, he schedules client consultations and keeps up with the latest fitness trends to stay current in his field. 
          Josh also maintains a strong online presence through social media, sharing fitness content. In the evenings, he dedicates 
          time to his own workouts, ensuring he's in great shape despite the demands of his student and work life. After a productive day, 
          he relaxes with friends, family, or hobbies, prioritizing a good night's rest to recharge. Josh's life revolves around the dual 
          roles of being a student and a dedicated exercise trainer, all while focusing on self-improvement and personal wellness.

          I chose the scenario of my persona trying to make it to the gym before class but in the process he takes the 
          long way which results in him not making it to the gym or class then a girl comes out of nowhere and mentions
          the app to him which would've saved him a lot more time than taking the long way.

          My teams sketches is an example of how the interface of the application will ultimately look like.
          They also show how the layout of the application will look like and how each button will take you
          to a different point in the application and how those screens will look like in the application.
