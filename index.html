        <p>
          New students arrive at the University with no way of knowing how to get to class the fastest way, 
          the best place to park, or even what dining halls would be the most convenient. This causes students
          a lot of stress since map apps will take you on the main route, which might be 10 minutes longer than 
          a short cut or you do not know where other dining halls are, so they are stuck eating the same one every
          day.
